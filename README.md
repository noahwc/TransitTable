# TransitTable
A Vue based webapp for viewing bus schedules in Victoria, BC. Input a stop number to see that stop's schedule.

While the current scope of this project is to provide bus schedules solely for Victoria, BC it should be relatively easy to replace the transit data found in the `/json` directory with that of a different city. The app relies on modified GTFS data which has been preprocessed with [gtfs-pyparse](https://github.com/noahwc/gtfs-pyparse).

The data displayed by this app is provided by BC Transit and preprocessed with [gtfs-pyparse](https://github.com/noahwc/gtfs-pyparse).
